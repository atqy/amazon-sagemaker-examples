    "## Background\n",
    "This notebook is part of a series of notebooks whose purpose is to demonstrate additional features implemented within the built-in SageMaker Linear Learner algorithm, namely early stopping, loss functions, and class weights. If you want more theoretical background behind these features, please see the [README.md](README.md). This is the first notebook in the series, which demonstrates the use of these features with the default binary classifier. You can choose to run this notebook by itself or in sequence with the other notebooks listed below. \n",

    "## Hands-on example: Detecting credit card fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll look at a credit card fraud detection dataset.  The data set (Dal Pozzolo et al. 2015) was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data).  We have features and labels for over a quarter million credit card transactions, each of which is labeled as fraudulent or not fraudulent.  We'd like to train a model based on the features of these transactions so that we can predict risky or fraudulent transactions in the future.  This is a binary classification problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll walk through training linear learner with various settings and deploying an inference endpoint.  We'll evaluate the quality of our models by hitting that endpoint with observations from the test set.  We can take the real-time predictions returned by the endpoint and evaluate them against the ground-truth labels in our test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll apply the linear learner threshold tuning functionality to get better precision without sacrificing recall.  Then, we'll push the precision even higher using the linear learner new class weights feature.  Because fraud can be extremely costly, we would prefer to have high recall, even if this means more false positives.  This is especially true if we are building a first line of defense, flagging potentially fraudulent transactions for further review before taking actions that affect customers."

    "#### Note on target vs. observed recall\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth taking some time to look more closely at these results.  If we asked linear learner for a model calibrated to a target recall of 0.9, then why didn't we get exactly 90% recall on the test set?  The reason is the difference between training, validation, and testing.  Linear learner calibrates thresholds for binary classification on the validation data set when one is provided, or else on the training set.  Since we did not provide a validation data set, the threshold were calculated on the training data.  Since the training, validation, and test data sets don't match exactly, the target recall we request is only an approximation.  In this case, the threshold that produced 90% recall on the training data happened to produce only 85-90% recall on the test data (due to some randomness in training, the results will vary from one run to the next).  The variation of recall in the test set versus the training set is dependent on the number of positive points. In this example, although we have over 280,000 examples in the entire dataset, we only have 337 positive examples, hence the large difference.  The accuracy of this approximation can be improved by providing a large validation data set to get a more accurate threshold, and then evaluating on a large test set to get a more accurate benchmark of the model and its threshold.  For even more fine-grained control, we can set the number of calibration samples to a higher number.  It's default value is already quite high at 10 million samples:\n",

Try using class weights in your binary classification problem, or try one of the new loss functions for your regression problems: use quantile prediction to put confidence intervals around your predictions by learning 5% and 95% quantiles.
